# Cryptopals
Solutions for the Cryptopals challenges written in Python 3.5. Much of the code may just be snippets. Each Set file contains the solutions to the checks. Most code is commented for testing purposes. Requires fairly simple Libraries, with the exception of PyCrypto. Most solutions are preliminary and therefore have not been fully optimized. 

### Problem Sets
Problem sets can be found on the [Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/) website and are not duplicated in any of the files.

### Thoughts
As I progress, this section will be populated with any specific notes or thoughts on interesting challenges.
